# Connect4Matlab
This was a project I did before taking any machine learning classes.
Would be significantly better to use a min max search and use alpha beta pruning. But it was fun to make!

Some of these were played around with but then unused. The only immportant file I made is c4.m. The simpleGameEngine.m is not my code.
